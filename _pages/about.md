I am a Ph.D student at the [School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://math.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) under the supervision of Prof. [Jie Ma](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~jiema/). From 2024 to 2025, I am a visiting Ph.D student at [the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Victoria (UVic)](https://www.uvic.ca/science/math-statistics/) in Canada under Prof. [Jonathan A. Noel](https://jonathannoel.ca/). In 2019, I completed my B.Sc at the [School of Mathematical Sciences, Soochow University](https://math.suda.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Prof. [Lijun Ji](https://web.suda.edu.cn/jilijun/).

My research interest includes Extremal Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Graph Limits.

You can find my CV here: [CV](../assets/CV.pdf).
